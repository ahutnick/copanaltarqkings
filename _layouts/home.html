<p><strong>Copan Altar Q</strong> constitutes one of the most complete king lists
    remaining from the ancient Maya world. With each of the 16 kings in the
    Classic era dynasty, the altar tracks roughly four hundred years of the
    city’s history. Seated at the foot of the stairway to 10L-16, the Temple
    of the Founder, this altar connects his last successor Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat
    to Yax K'uk Mo' himself. Explore each of the kings and their own monumental creations
    below, searching for the answers to the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>How did the historical situation in Copan affect their monuments?</li>
    <li>What were the kings’ rhetorical strategies?</li>
    <li>Where did these motifs come from?</li>
    </ul>
