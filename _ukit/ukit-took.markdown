</ul>

After the strong poetic conclusion to the dynasty that could be found in
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/altar-q">Altar Q</a> and Stela 18 came <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/altar-l">Altar L</a>, evidence of a new ruler. Ukit Took, whose name means "Patron of Flint", is rarely considered to be a part
of the Classic Copan dynasty (Martin and Grube 2008, 213). Though he depicts himself with <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a> in traditionally Copan garb, his unusual name and his lack of mention in the record cast doubt on his reputation.

His only monument tells us a single crucial piece about
his reign - it was cut dramatically short. Only one face of the altar was
ever completed.

By this point in Copan, overpopulation and lack of resources due to deforestation and soil erosion led to disease and chronic malnourishment (Martin and Grube 2008, 213). While <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a>'s reign ended softly but definitively, Ukit Took failed to rally the people of Copan to continue the monarchy. Though its people would continue to live in the city, the dynasty of kings had come to an end.
