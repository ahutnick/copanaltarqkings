# Caracol Stela 16

#### <strong>Location</strong>: Caracol
#### <strong>Dates</strong>: 9.5.0.0.0 11 Ahau 18 Zec  / July 13, 534
#### <strong>Kings</strong>: 7

Though we know little about the context, Caracol Stela 16 marks the first confirmed mention of a Copan king outside of the Southeastern region (Martin and Grube 2008, 197).

While one side depicts the Caracol king K'an I, commissioner of this monument, the textual side describes the erection of the stelae as well as family and political relations (Grube 1990; Martin and Grube 2008, 87). Interestingly, in discussing his parents and grandfather, K'an I uses the "child of the mother" glyph, specifically invoking both of his parents (Grube 1990). After a now illegible portion of the text, K'an I discusses <em>yitah</em> and <em>ts'akab</em> - siblinghood and succession respectively - which may indicate a network of related royalty throughout the region. The text continues with a "royal woman from Xultun", a city in the Peten region in Guatemala and concludes with reference to "Copan Ahau" <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a> (Martin and Grube 2008, 87; Grube 1990).

With the focus on family in the text, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a> may have been a relative of K'an I. The Founder himself, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a>, is presumed to have been from Caracol before rising through the political ranks at Tikal, which may have had some impact (Price et al. 2010). <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-63">Stela 63</a> even refers to "Uxwitza" when discussing the Founder, which David Stuart proposes is a direct reference to the city of Caracol (Martin and Grube 2008, 193). Unfortunately, we do not currently know why the seventh king's name appears here, whether he was an ally or relative (Martin and Grube 2008, 87). Regardless, the fact that his name appears at all speaks to Copan's power at this time (Grube 1990). The thirteenth ruler <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/waxaklajuun-ubaah-kawiil">Waxaklajuun Ubaah K'awiil</a> would later claim that Copan could be considered a fourth Maya Lowland Capital along with Tikal, Palenque, and Calakmul on his <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-a">Stela A</a> (Fash 2011, 59). With Copan's influence reaching to Caracol beyond its immediate control, the thirteenth ruler's claims may have been justified.
