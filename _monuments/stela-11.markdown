<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a>'s funerary "stela" marked a stark contrast to both Copan's previous style and the king's efforts. Stela 11 is not a true freestanding stela, but rather a carved column supporting the doorway (Martin and Grube 2008, 212). The monument is completed in low relief and depicts the final king in warrior garb (Martin and Grube 2008, 212). Of note, warrior garb as a motif had been established as a technique particularly used to assert authority after thirteenth king <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/waxaklajuun-ubaah-kawiil">Waxaklajuun Ubaah K'awiil</a>'s execution.

Similarly, Temple 18, which houses this monument, provides more specific sacrifice messages - i.e. depicting heads of captives as trophies - than any previous structure (Fash 1991, 170). Yet, no evidence exists of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a> being a war-monger while evidence does exist of him being a diplomat. In the decade before his death, he appeared in a Quirigua text participating in a ritual with their king, insinuating that the two cities had made amends (Martin and Grube 2008, 225). This move may have been intended to convince the elites of the sixteenth king's might and authority in the time of a city in decline.

Stela 11 is a Type VI with a wraparound figural pattern and two brief columns of text (Fash 2004, 259; Martin and Grube 2008, 212). On it, the king faces left in low relief profile. A torch emerges from his forehead, symbolizing his apotheosis as the God K, patron of kings. He stands on a shell signaling the entrance to the Underworld and is guided into it by the Maize God (Fash 1991, 177; Martin and Grube 2008, 212). Crossed band glyphs appear on his belt, referring perhaps to the Founder and the Foundation or Origin House. Stela 11 only contains part of the text with the rest on the other columns and furniture (Martin and Grube 2008, 212).

One possible reading of the text refers to the "toppling of the Foundation House", which is believed to mean the ending of the lineage (Martin and Grube 2008, 212). The Foundation House or Origin House was also found in Altar Q to refer to the location assumedly in Teotihuacan where <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a> acceded the throne (Stuart 2007). Fittingly, the text also mentions the <em>waxaklajuun ubaah kaan</em>, or Teotihuacan war serpent, continuing the appeal to Teotihuacan's former glory as well as the frequent war motif (Martin and Grube 2008, 213). The text concludes with <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a>'s names, cementing the bond between the first and last rulers.

The temple itself had already been looted assumedly in the century after his burial, speaking to the people's need for resources and attitude towards the kings. Few pieces of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj</a>'s body remained, and Stela 11 was found broken in half (Fash 1991, 177). Far from <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/structure-16">Hunal</a>, the Founder's impressive tomb, the state of Temple 18 truly reflected the toppling of the lineage.
