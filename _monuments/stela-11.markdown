# Stela 11

#### <strong>Location</strong>: Temple 18
#### <strong>Date</strong>: 9.19.10.0.0 8 Ahau 8 Xul / 820 CE
#### <strong>Kings</strong>: 16, 1

Stela 11, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a>'s funerary stela marked a stark contrast to both Copan's previous style and the king's efforts. The stela is completed in low relief and depicts the final king in warrior garb (Martin and Grube 2008, 212). Of note, warrior garb as a motif had been established as a technique particularly used to assert authority after thirteenth king <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/waxaklajuun-ubaah-kawiil">Waxaklajuun Ubaah K'awiil</a>'s execution.

However, Temple 18, which houses this stela, provides more specific sacrifice messages - i.e. having heads of captives aws trophies - than any previous structure (Fash 1991, 170). This occurrence appears odd because we have no evidence of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a> as a war-monger, and we do have evidence of him as a diplomat. In the decade before his death he appeared in a Quirigua text participating in a ritual together, meaning that the two cities had apparently made amends (Martin and Grube 2008, 225). This move may have been intended to convince the elites of the sixteenth king's might and authority in the time of a city in decline.

As the funerary temple for the last recognized king in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a> lineage, Temple 18 reveals the state of the city at the time of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a>. The temple was built much smaller and less sturdy than previous tombs with weaker monuments. Stela 11 is not even freestanding, but was instead carved into a pillar supporting a door (Martin and Grube 2008, 212).

The funerary stela is a Type VI Stela with a wraparound figural pattern and two brief columns of text (Fash 2004, 259; Martin and Grube 2008, 212). On it, the king faces left in low relief profile. A torch emerges from his forehead, symbolizing his apotheosis as the God K, patron of kings. He stands on a shell signaling the entrance to the Underworld and is guided into it by the Maize God (Fash 1991, 177; Martin and Grube 2008, 212). Crossed band glyphs appear on his belt, referring to the Founder and the Foundation House. Interpretation of the text is simple with the king entering the Underworld as a god, harkening back to the Founder and the closing of the monarchic lineage.

The text itself lists the date and refers to the "toppling of the Foundation House", which is believed to mean the ending of the lineage. The Foundation House was also used in Altar Q to refer to the location assumedly in Teotihuacan where <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a>. acceded the throne (Sdouz 2015, 90). Fittingly, the text also mentions the <em>waxaklajuun ubaah chan</em>, or Teotihuacan war serpent, continuing the appeal to Teotihuacan's former glory as well as the frequent war motif (Martin and Grube 2008, 213). The text concludes with <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a>'s names, cementing the bond between the first and last rulers.

The temple itself had already been looted assumedly in the century after his burial, speaking to the people's need for resources and attitude towards the kings (Fash 1991, 177). His stela would be found broken in half (Fash 1991, 177).
