# Copan Altar L

#### <strong>Location:</strong> North Ballcourt
#### <strong>Dates:</strong> 822
#### <strong>Rulers:</strong> 17, 16

This fascinating altar sat on the North Ballcourt, never to be completed.
The North side had been sketched in though never realized with only the
South side finished. Two rulers sit in mirrored profile - similar to the
Motmot Marker and to Altar Q - facing the date glyphs - 3 Chicchan 3 Uo. The final glyph refers to a seating expression (Grube and Schele 1986, 157).

As on Altar Q, both men sit on their name glyphs - on the left a newcomer Ukit Took, on the right Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat (Martin and Grube 2008, 213). Each
king is dressed almost identically to the kings on Altar Q, complete with the
turbans unique to Copan (Martin and Grube 2008, 201). Yax Pasaj also holds the
same  scepter as the other kings on Altar Q, indicating a transfer of office (Schele and Grube 1986, 158).

Both of the men wear evidence of underworld or ancestor imagery. Yax Pasaj is
more prominent in this regard with the K'awiil scepter in his forehead. This motif is commonly used in the posthumous portrait to evoke the king's elevation, taking his place as God K the patron of kings  (Schele 1987, 170; Fash 1991, 177). Yax K'uk Mo' has a similar motif in Yax Pasaj's funerary stela, Stela 11. To complete their similar dress with underworld meanings, both men wear witz-monster pectorals with zoomorphic heads with the T-shaped monster's mouth. Both kings also bear cauac markings.

Furthermore, as with Stela C, Yax Pasaj has a beard, which is indicative of his age and possible ancestor status (Grube and Schele 1986, 157). The evidence is strong that the confirmed king has switched roles and is now being invoked to confirm Ukit Took's place as royalty. Fascinatingly, Ukit Took defers to Yax Pasaj rather than Yax Kuk Mo, indicating some deeper connection or a general respect for the last confirmed king of the Classic Copan dynasty. Fascinatingly, by being placed on the left of Yax Pasaj, Ukit Took draws a parallel between himself and Yax K'uk Mo as a new founder. Stela 11 described Yax Pasaj as the last in the lineage, so Ukit Took through this confirmation is both continuing  the royal tradition at Copan and starting his own lineage (Fash 1991, 178)

Yax Pasaj's last confirmed appearance was in 810, a full twelve years before any mention of Ukit Took, although William Fash proposed that Yax Pasaj survived until 820 due to a date on Stela 11. Regardless, one may question why so much time passed before the any of Ukit Took's monuments or mention. Yet, with the decline of the city due to lack of resources and political tensions, even completing an altar was an impossible feat. Even Altar Q fifty years prior had had issues in its construction. Ukit Took attempted to rally the city, but the dynasty was already in the process of falling. Life would continue in Las Sepulturas, but the Acropolis would not (Schele and Grube 1986, 158-159). Stone monuments would be pilfered to build houses, and this version of Copan would end without much fanfare, like the construction of Altar L (Martin and Grube 2008, 213).
