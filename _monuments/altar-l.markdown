# Copan Altar L

#### <strong>Location:</strong> North Ballcourt
#### <strong>Dates:</strong> 822
#### <strong>Rulers:</strong> 17, 16

After the strong poetic conclusion to the dynasty that could be found in
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/altar-q">Altar Q</a> and Stela 18 came <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/altar-l">Altar L</a>, evidence of a new ruler. Ukit Took', whose name means "Patron of Flint", is rarely considered to be a part
of the Classic Copan dynasty (Martin and Grube 2008, 213). Though he depicts himself with <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a> in traditional Copan garb, his unusual name and his lack of mention in the record cast doubt on his reputation.

His only monument tells us a single crucial piece about
his reign - it was cut dramatically short. Only one face of the altar was
ever completed.

This fascinating altar sat on the North Ballcourt, never to be completed.
Only the South side was finished, with the North side merely sketched in. Two rulers sit in mirrored profile - similar to the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/motmot-marker">Motmot Marker</a> and to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/altar-q">Altar Q</a> - facing the date glyphs - 3 Chicchan 3 Uo. The final glyph refers to a seating expression (Grube and Schele 1986, 157).

As on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/altar-q">Altar Q</a>, both men sit on their name glyphs - on the left newcomer Ukit Took', on the right <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a> (Martin and Grube 2008, 213). Each king is dressed almost identically to the kings on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/altar-q">Altar Q</a>, complete with the turbans unique to Copan (Martin and Grube 2008, 201). <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj</a> also holds k'awiil, indicating a transfer of office (Schele and Grube 1986, 158).

Both of the men wear evidence of underworld or ancestor imagery. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj</a> is more prominent in this regard with the k'awiil scepter in his forehead. This motif is commonly used in the posthumous portrait to evoke the king's elevation, taking his place as K'awiil the patron of kings (Schele 1987, 170; Fash 1991, 177). <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk Mo'</a> has a similar motif in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj</a>'s funerary stela, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-11">Stela 11</a>. To complete their similar dress with underworld meanings, both men wear Witz pectorals with zoomorphic heads with its T-shaped  mouth as well as Witz markings (Fash 1991, 177).

Furthermore, as with Stela C, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj</a> has a beard, which is indicative of his age and possible ancestor status (Grube and Schele 1986, 157). The previously confirmed king has switched roles and is now being invoked to confirm Ukit Took's place as royalty. Fascinatingly, the supposed seventeenth king defers to his predecessor rather than to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a>, indicating some deeper connection or a general respect for the last confirmed king of the Classic Copan dynasty. Fascinatingly, by being placed on the left of the sixteenth king, Ukit Took' may draws a parallel between himself and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk Mo</a> as a new founder. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-11">Stela 11</a> described <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj</a> as the last in the lineage, so the apparent last king through this confirmation both would continue the royal tradition at Copan and start his own lineage (Fash 1991, 178).

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj</a>'s last confirmed appearance was in 810, a full twelve years before any mention of Ukit Took', although it has been proposed that the sixteenth king survived until 820 due to a date on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-11">Stela 11</a>. Regardless, one may question why so much time passed before any monuments or mention of the supposed last king. Yet, with the decline of the city due to lack of resources and political tensions, even completing an altar was an impossible feat. Even <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/altar-q">Altar Q</a> fifty years prior had had issues in its construction (Sdouz 2015, 83-85). Ukit Took' attempted to rally the city, but the dynasty was already in the process of falling. Life would continue in Las Sepulturas, but the Acropolis would not (Schele and Grube 1986, 158-159). Stone monuments would be pilfered to build houses, and this version of the monarchy at Copan would end without much fanfare, like the construction of Altar L (Martin and Grube 2008, 213).
