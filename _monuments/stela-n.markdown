Stela N is fifteenth ruler <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kahk-yipyaj-chan-kawiil">K'ahk' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil</a>'s second stela after <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-m">Stela M</a>. He continues his style of high relief with depth at almost one and a half feet and figural detail wrapping around the sides. This stela is classified as a Type V with two figural sides and 2 textual sides, though the text on the east and west sides comprise of only one column (Fash 2004, 259; Baudez 1994, 83). Underneath the stela is cached five bowls, ten flower pots, and stalactites, noticeably less extravagant than even <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-m">Stela M</a>'s offerings, which contained a spondylus shell and jadeite (Baudez 1994, 83, 74). The stela is paired with a zoomorphic altar.

Both the north side and south side depict a young king seemingly emerging from the mouth of the Witz' creature and by connection the Underworld. Both figures wear a waterlily headdress being eaten by a fish surrounded by braid and tassel as well as a beaded cape, pectoral mask, serpent bar, and square earrings (Baudez 1994, 83). God K heads emerge out of the serpent bar on both sides. Both men also have ancestor figures above their heads and a witz entity by their feet, sinking back into the Underworld (Baudez 1994, 84). However, whereas the north face wears an assumedly serpentine helmet, the south figure's helmet is crocodilian (Baudez 1994, 85). On both sides, the kings are surrounded by fertility spirits adorned with waterlily blossoms and Witz' elements (Baudez 1994, 86).

The text mentions both <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kahk-joplaj-chan-kawiil">K'ahk' Joplaj Chan K'awiil</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kahk-yipyaj-chan-kawiil">K'ahk' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil</a>'s accession dates, yet also seems to mention <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a> by name as "New Sky at Horizon" or "Rising Sun" (Schele and Grube 1988, 289; Baudez 1994, 87). This title is also believed to be the name of the stela <Baudez 1994, 87). It has been suggested that the figures represented on this stela are <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kahk-yipyaj-chan-kawiil">K'ahk' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat</a> for this reason. In this case, the invocation of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kahk-joplaj-chan-kawiil">K'ahk' Joplaj Chan K'awiil</a> would serve to anchor the lineage and further add authority to the fifteenth king declaring his successor. Of note, the stela is placed at the base of Temple 11, previously known as the "lineage house of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a>, potentially providing a further anchor (Fash 1991, 168).

This action would explain why both kings appear young and why they both appear to emerge from the Underworld rather than one going into the Underworld (Baudez 1994, 87). It would also explain why the figures appear on the north and south sides of the stela rather than the more traditional west and east for death and rebirth respectively. The fertility imagery in the abundance of water lily motifs and bacabs may further provide authority to the lineage as being responsible for the continuation of this cycle.
