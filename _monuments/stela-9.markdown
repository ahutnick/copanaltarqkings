#### <strong>Location:</strong> Uncertain

This stela was created by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/moon-jaguar">Moon Jaguar</a> roughly midway through his reign. Unfortunately, it had previously been destroyed and was used as part of the base for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-pasaj-chan-yopaat">Yax Pasaj</a>'s Stela 8 (Schele 1987, 235). From the fragments, this stela is classified as Type IV, with three sides carved with glyphs and one figural side (Fash 2004, 259).

Interestingly, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/moon-jaguar">Moon Jaguar</a> refers to himself as the "ninth child in the lineage of Copan" yet does not mention <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk Mo'</a> or use the typical succession title (MacLeod 1988, 339; Schele 1986a, 2).

However, while the tenth ruler does not name the Founder, he does name his father, which was not particularly common on Copan stelae (see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-63">Stela 63</a>, Stela 10, and Stela N). Here, Moon Jaguar mentions the seventh ruler <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a>, or Waterlily Jaguar, with the <em>u ahau</em> or "child of the father" glyph (Schele 1986b, 59). Of particular note is that <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/moon-jaguar">Moon Jaguar</a> refers to his father with the "Ma K'inah" title usually reserved for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk Mo'</a>. Given that <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a> is the only other king with "Jaguar" in his title, no other kings in the lineage present themselves as potential candidates. The text also describes the father as being a "one katun lord", and given that <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a> reigned from 524 - 532, he would have been within one katun (Schele 1986b, 59). Schele speculates that Wi Yohl K'inich and Ruler 9 were also sons of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a> (1987, 236). In the bloodletting glyphs associated with parentage - with the blood referring to the child - the glyphs are believed to have used the -tal suffix then popular in Copan and Palenque (MacLeod 1988, 340).

Of note, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-e">Stela E</a>, a successor by <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/waxaklajuun-ubaah-kawiil">Waxaklajuun Ubaah K'awiil</a> also commemorates <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a>, although the context is somewhat vague (Martin and Grube 2008, 197).

The hero of the stela's text is not <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/moon-jaguar">Moon Jaguar</a> specifically, but U-Chac-Xib-Chac, a rain and lightning god in the Palenque Triad also known as G1 (Schele 1987, 236; Coe 1989, 182). The god's name is written with a shell-fist glyph as is seen on Stela I. Interestingly, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a> also has a title using a shell-fist glyph (Schele 1987, 236). Through this stela, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/moon-jaguar">Moon Jaguar</a> presents himself in the character of a god. The serpent bar is also present on this stela, showing his connection to and power over the divine (Schele 1987, 235).

While this stela does mention the Founder briefly, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/moon-jaguar">Moon Jaguar</a> instead gives his father the greater honor and glorifies himself as a god in an impressive display of authority and inheritance.
