On <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/altar-q">Altar Q</a>, Moon Jaguar is found sitting on a Waterlily Jaguar glyph, which is probably in reference to his father, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a> (Schele 1986, 57).

The tenth king's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-9">Stela 9</a> is notable for two particular reasons. First, it reveals <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a>, the seventh king, to be Moon Jaguar's father. Moon Jaguar even goes so far as to refer to his father with Ma Kina, a title usually reserved for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a> (Schele 1986, 59). Second, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-9">Stela 9</a> is the first stela to include figural depictions since the second king <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/popol-hol">Popol Hol's</a> reign (Schele 1987, 235; Fash 2004, 255). This return to form would give way to impressive works of high relief from future kings. Unfortunately, due to the monument's previous destruction, little information is available about Moon Jaguar's figural style. Moon Jaguar's other confirmed monument, Stela 17, is classified as a Type II stela with two sides carved only with glyphs, denying further information (Fash 2004, 259).  

Interestingly, Moon Jaguar erected both <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-9">Stela 9</a> and Stela 17 in the village of Copan Ruinas rather than the Acropolis like most of his predecessors (Martin and Grube 2008, 199). With this decision, the tenth king focused on speaking directly to the people rather than creating more ritualistically significant stelae. Both his successor <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/butz-chan">Butz' Chan</a> and the twelfth king <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kahk-uti-witz-kawiil">K'ahk' Uti' Witz' K'awiil</a> would continue this tradition of creating stelae in the village. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kahk-uti-witz-kawiil">K'ahk' Uti' Witz' K'awiil</a> would even go so far as to create stelae on the edge of Copan's control to celebrate and cement the city's expansion (Martin and Grube 2008, 201).
