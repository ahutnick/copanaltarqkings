** Altar Q Image **

On Altar Q, Wi' Yohl K'inich's name was written in a cursive form, which may have simply been due to allotted space (Martin and Grube 2008, 197).  

Wi' Yohl K'inich was known for his creation of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/structure-16">Rosalila Temple</a>. This three level structure was the sixth incarnation of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/structure-16">Structure 16</a> at the center of the Acropolis (Martin and Grube 2008, 198). The Temple itself served as a house of ancestor worship complete with underworld motifs and stations for kings to communicate with their predecessors through autosacrifice (Fasquelle 2004, 109). The structure contained numerous references to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a> apotheosized as the Sun God, appearing as an avian sun in various phases (Fash 2011, 43). The temple would last until the reign of the thirteenth king <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/waxaklajuun-ubaah-kawiil">Waxaklajuun Ubaah K'awiil</a>, who would ritually bury it intact under ritual white paint (Martin and Grube 2008, 204; Fasquelle 2004, 102).

The Temple spared no expense with its impressive stucco work and vibrant colors. Yet, it would be the last structure of its kind at Copan, as overpopulation had led to deforestation, limiting available resources to produce the stucco (Martin and Grube 2008, 198). During this century, the city had surpassed its capacity (Martin and Grube 2008, 213).

Wi' Yohl K'inich was also known for his construction of the Ante Structure to replace previous palaces (Martin and Grube 2008, 197). In front of this structure was a stair detailing his accession and the dedication of the structure in circa 541. This structure in part helped deduce that Wi' Yohl K'inich was the long contested occupant of the Sub Jaguar tomb.

Previously, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ruler-9">Ruler 9</a>, and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/moon-jaguar">Moon Jaguar</a> were considered potential candidates due to their time of death (Martin and Grube 2008, 199). Yet, the tomb was to the west on the same axis as the Ante Structure, adding symbolic significance. Furthermore, the offerings when tested were found to have originated in about 550, in time for Wi' Yohl K'inich's burial in 551 (Price et al. 2011). While not definitive, evidence does exist that this is Wi' Yohl K'inich's tomb.

While no stelae remain from Wi' Yohl K'inich's reign, he completed impressive structural renovations, including for a lavish location for kings to commune with their ancestors. The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/structure-16">Rosalila Temple</a> also proves that worship of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/yax-kuk-mo">Yax K'uk' Mo'</a> continued from <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/popol-hol">Popol Hol</a>'s influence. This occurrence had previously been suggested by the eighth king's predecessor, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn">Bahlam Nehn</a> being the first king to refer to himself in relation to his succession from Yax K'uk' Mo' (Martin and Grube 2008, 197). This trend would certainly flourish into the Late Classic period.
