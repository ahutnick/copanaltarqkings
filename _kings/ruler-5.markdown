# Ruler 5

#### <strong>Reign:</strong> Uncertain
#### <strong>Preceded by:</strong> <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/kaltuun-hix">K'altuun Hix</a>

#### <strong>Structures:</strong>

<li>Unknown</li>
</ul>

Not much is known about Ruler 5 - information between 437 and 524 - <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/popol-hol/">Popol Hol</a>'s reign and the start of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bahlam-nehn/">Bahlam Nehn</a>'s - is limited at best.

This king may have been mentioned on Quirigua Monument 26. The 480 CE monument mentions an event supervised an <em>ochkâ€™in kaloomte</em>, which at Quirigua in this time referred to a Copan king (Martin and Grube 2008, 217). If Ruler 5 ruled during this time, he may very well be that king.
