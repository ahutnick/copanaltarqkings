Despite his Teotihuacan garb on Altar Q, oxygen and strontium testing have confirmed that Yax K'uk' Mo' was originally from neither Copan nor Teotihuacan. His larger levels of strontium suggest that he spent much of his time in Central Peten, though a shift in ratios also suggests that he spent time perhaps in childhood in a different central or southern region (Price et al. 2011). David Stuart had previously suggested that the Founder was from Caracol due to the use of the term <em>uxwitza' ajaw</em> or Three Hills Place Lord on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-63">Stela 63</a> (Fash 2011, 105). One theory claims that Yax K'uk' Mo' spent part of his childhood in Caracol before advancing his political career in Tikal. According to Copan's  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-15">Stela 15</a>, Yax K'uk' Mo' was present in Copan in 8.19.0.0.0, over ten years before his accession, insinuating that he was sent to the city before he was confirmed as its next new king (Stuart 2004, 223).

While the theory is not conclusive, Tikal had notably been taken over in a similar manner to Copan by Sihyaj K'ahk', a general with strong ties to Teotihuacan, in 378 CE (Martin and Grube 2008, 30). Sihyaj K'ah' would preside over the accession of Yax Nuun Ahin I,  the son of Teotihuacan king Spearthrower Owl and a Tikal noblewoman, cementing a "New Order" in the Maya city (Martin and Grube 2008, 30-32). Given Tikal's strong ties to Teotihuacan, Yax K'uk' Mo' - then Ajaw K'uk' Mo' - could have gained status in Tikal and been chosen to be confirmed at Teotihuacan as the next king of Copan. As a center of trade routes between the Maya region and the rest of Central America, and with its proximity to Quirigua and its relation to the obsidian and jade routes to and from the Caribbean, Copan would have been an advantageous city to have under its influence (Price et al 2010).

Altar Q states that for his accession , Yax K'uk' Mo', then Ajaw K'uk' Mo' received K'awiil in Wiin te'naah or Origin House likely in Teotihuacan on September 6, 426 (Stuart 2004, 233, 237). Three days later, he departed from this place (Stuart 2004, 235). One hundred fifty-three days later, he - the "West Kaloomte" - arrived at Copan (Stuart 2004, 238).

Similar to the events at Tikal, Yax K'uk' Mo' upon his arrival seized control of the throne from the city's previous king Smoke Codex God K, beginning his own lineage (Schele 1986, 4). Copan also underwent a significant redesign around this time though Yax K'uk' Mo' did largely work with the existing architectural layout (Traxler 2004, 55).

Shortly after his arrival in Copan, Yax K'uk' Mo' would witness another king's accession at the Foundation House: Quirigua's first king, Tok Casper (Martin and Grube 2008, 216). Copan would continue to have control over Quirigua and the Motagua Valley for roughly three hundred years.  

Like Yax Nuun Ahin I's father , Yax K'uk' Mo' also married into local Copan nobility, assumedly to further legitimize his seizure of the throne (Martin and Grube 2008, 196). Their son, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/popol-hol">Popol Hol</a>, may have ruled with his father as co-regent for some time. According to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/stela-63">Stela 63</a> and the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/motmot-marker">Motomot Marker</a>, both men bore witness to the auspicious 9.0.0.0.0 bak'tun ending (Martin and Grube 2008, 194). <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/popol-hol">Popol Hol</a> would spend much of his reign building his father's legacy, constructing his tomb as well as creating structures for his worship. Like Yax Nuun Ahin I, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/popol-hol">Popol Hol</a>'s task was to invoke his father as a local king with Lowland Maya garb and deities while paying homage to his Teotihuacan patronage. Accordingly, mention of his connections to Teotihuacan would decrease until the Late Classic Period. The first king's tomb would incorporate both aspects of this narrative.

Yax K'uk' Mo' was buried in the Hunal Tomb in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/structure-16"> Structure 10L-16</a> (Martin and Grube 2008, 195). The tomb itself was constructed in the  talud tablero style, and the king wore a composite shell headdress - both of which hailed from Teotihuacan (Traxler 2004, 58; Price et al. 2011). The talud tablero style however had been adapted in both the Maya Highland and Lowland regions at the time and showed influence from both locations (Traxler 2004, 58). Likewise, the burial itself followed Lowland Maya tradition. Yax K'uk' Mo' was laid out in a supine position on a stone bier. He was buried with a variety of pottery from Copan, Central Mexico, the Highlands, and Lowlands. Interestingly, the king's body had survived several fractures and blunt force trauma, indicating a history as a warrior (Price et al. 2011). His right arm was among these fractures as was depicted on Altar Q (Martin and Grube 2008, 193).

His son's efforts would take root, and Yax K'uk' Mo' would continue to be worshipped and invoked by his successors as a sign of legitimacy, strength, and prosperity. In <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/structure-16">Structure 10L-1</a>, he would be apotheosized and worshipped as the Sun God, and he would appear on countless stelae and other monuments. Yax K'uk' Mo' the foreign king would become the figurehead for Classic Copan and a god to each of his successors.
